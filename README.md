# JDBCProgram
This java program uses JDBC concept and Socket Programming together.
I made this program as a part SPPU syllabus of Third Year Engineering in Skills Development Lab

Note: 
The above project was created using Idea IntelliJ and a separate JDBC connector driver will be required for this program
Do NOT clone this project using any IDE, instead download it and open it.
Steps for execution
1. Open both JDBCServer and JDBC CLient folder as 2 separate projects in IntelliJ Idea
2. Run the Server code followed by Client code (if not followed the order then the code will stop unexpectedly)
3. Done
